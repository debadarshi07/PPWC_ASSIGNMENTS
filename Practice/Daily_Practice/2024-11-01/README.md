<h2>Problem:</h2>
<p>Create a function which takes two strings as arguments and copy one string into other.</p>

<h3>Solution Approach:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Traversed using a while loop until it reaches upto the last character of the source string which is a null termination.</li>
    <li>In each iteration, mapped a single element from source string to destination string.</li>
    <li>In the main method created source and destination string using dynamic memory allocation and used the string copy method to check whether it's working properly or not.</li>
    <li>Lastly, printed the destination string and freed all the dynamically allocated memory spaces.</li>
</ul>
